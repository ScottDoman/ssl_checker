# ssl_checker
A simple platform agnostic tool to check ssl certificates

# Usage
After build, you can run the tool against any text file using ./ssl-monitor --urls urls.txt
Basically, the argument --urls will let you define the plaintext file with the urls in.

It's exactly what it says on the tin, really.
